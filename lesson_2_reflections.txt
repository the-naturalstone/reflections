What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A git repository is created when a repository is initialized. The repositiory is needed as 
it has the ability to track the state of the files currently in the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is where one can determine what files/items are ready for commit, 
as not all files may need to be committed as that time. The working directory shows what is not considered for committing,
or in other words what is still being worked on. The value is being able to have control over how one wants to think about,
saving changes and tracking items in their repositiory.
